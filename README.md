[Rhyme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhyme)

The word rhyme can be used in a specific and a general sense. In the specific sense, two words rhyme if their final stressed vowel and all following sounds are identical; two lines of poetry rhyme if their final strong positions are filled with rhyming words. A rhyme in the strict sense is also called a perfect rhyme. Examples are sight and flight, deign and gain, madness and sadness, love and dove.
Perfect rhymes
Main article: Perfect rhyme

Perfect rhymes can be classified by the location of the final stressed syllable.

    single, also known as masculine: a rhyme in which the stress is on the final syllable of the words (rhyme, sublime)
    double, also known as feminine: a rhyme in which the stress is on the penultimate (second from last) syllable of the words (picky, tricky)
    dactylic: a rhyme in which the stress is on the antepenultimate (third from last) syllable (amorous, glamorous)

Feminine and dactylic rhymes may also be realized as compound (or mosaic) rhymes (poet, know it).
General rhymes

In the general sense, general rhyme can refer to various kinds of phonetic similarity between words, and to the use of such similar-sounding words in organizing verse. Rhymes in this general sense are classified according to the degree and manner of the phonetic similarity:

    syllabic: a rhyme in which the last syllable of each word sounds the same but does not necessarily contain stressed vowels. (cleaver, silver, or pitter, patter; the final syllable of the words bottle and fiddle is /l/, a liquid consonant.)
    imperfect (or near): a rhyme between a stressed and an unstressed syllable. (wing, caring)
    weak (or unaccented): a rhyme between two sets of one or more unstressed syllables. (hammer, carpenter)
    semirhyme: a rhyme with an extra syllable on one word. (bend, ending)
    forced (or oblique): a rhyme with an imperfect match in sound. (green, fiend; one, thumb)
    assonance: matching vowels. (shake, hate) Assonance is sometimes referred to as slant rhymes, along with consonance.
    consonance: matching consonants. (rabies, robbers)
    half rhyme (or slant rhyme): matching final consonants. (hand , lend)
    pararhyme: all consonants match. (tick, tock)
    alliteration (or head rhyme): matching initial consonants. (ship, short)
